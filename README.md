Emotion AI :

This repo is a collection of few of EmotionAI prototypes I worked on. 

Apart fromt these I also developed an iOS app with an avatar interface that dynamically alters its facial expressions in response to detected emotions, employing expressive SSML, the MotionPortrait SDK,
and integrating Google's Text-To-Speech & Speech-To-Text APIs.  
Created a web app for demonstrating emotion detection and synthesis in customer care using voice-based emotion detection and speech diarization from QuickBooks audio recordings. I used Vokaturi APIs for 
emotion detection from voice and IBM's Speech Diarization APIs for spliting the audio of the participants in a customer care recording.


Presented at Intuit's QuickBooks Connect and Facebook's @Scale conference, and my proposal on emotion technologies was featured at GHC 2018.
